
WEBAPP VULNERABILITY SCANNER â€” PROJECT REPORT

1. Executive Summary
   This project provides an automated web application vulnerability scanning pipeline designed to run from GitHub (locally or via GitHub Actions). It targets common OWASP Top-10 risks such as injection, XSS, security misconfiguration, and weak TLS. The scanner produces machine-readable and human-readable reports that can be used in CI/CD pipelines.

Status: Draft based on standard patterns for GitHub-integrated scanners. Replace "Assumed" items with details from your repository.

2. Objectives

* Automate DAST scans against a target URL during pull requests and on a schedule.
* Fail builds on critical findings and show summaries in pull request comments.
* Archive artifacts (HTML and JSON reports) for triage and trend tracking.

3. Architecture (Assumed)

* Language: Python wrapper with containerized scanner.
* Core Scanners: Likely OWASP ZAP, Wapiti, Nikto, or Nuclei.
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows triggered on push, pull\_request, and nightly cron.
* Artifacts: SARIF, JSON, and HTML reports uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts or GitHub Security tab.

4. Usage and Setup (Assumed)
   Inputs: Target URL, optional exclude/include paths, authentication cookies or credentials via GitHub Secrets.
   Local Run Example: python main.py --url [https://example.com](https://example.com) --out ./reports
   GitHub Actions Workflow:
   Step 1: Checkout
   Step 2: Setup Python and containers
   Step 3: Run scan
   Step 4: Upload artifacts
   Step 5: (Optional) Upload SARIF results to GitHub Code Scanning

5. Findings (Template)
   Scan date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
   Target: <URL>
   Scope: <paths and exclusions>
   Authentication: <none or method used>

Summary by severity:
Critical: 0
High: 0
Medium: 0
Low: 0
Info: 0

Top issues (examples):

1. Reflected XSS in /search?q=. Unescaped input echoed in response.
   Risk: Token theft or session hijacking.
   Fix: Output encoding, CSP, and input validation.

2. TLS Weakness: Outdated ciphers supported.
   Fix: Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher with modern cipher suites.

3. Missing Security Headers: CSP and X-Frame-Options headers absent.
   Fix: Add headers per OWASP ASVS recommendations.

Reports: report.html, findings.json, results.sarif

6. Reliability and Limitations

* False positives and negatives are common in DAST; manual validation is needed.
* Authentication coverage requires stable login flows.
* Dynamic or JavaScript-heavy content may need headless browser support.
* Rate limits may need throttling to avoid denial-of-service-like behavior.

7. Recommendations

1) Document the exact scanner tools and their versions.
2) Configure CI pipeline to fail on Critical or High findings, warn on Medium.
3) Add authenticated scans for realistic coverage.
4) Use GitHub Secrets for tokens and never commit them.
5) Maintain baselines and trend analysis with weekly scans.
6) Provide developer guidance by mapping findings to OWASP Top 10, CWE, and ASVS.
7) Reduce noise with allowlists for known acceptable risks.

8. Maintenance

* Pin tool versions and update monthly.
* Re-scan after major application changes.
* Review exclusions and severity thresholds periodically.

9. Compliance Mapping (Template)

* OWASP Top 10: A1, A3, A5 (update per findings)
* CWE IDs: Map each finding to CWE identifiers
* ASVS/WSTG: Reference relevant controls and tests
